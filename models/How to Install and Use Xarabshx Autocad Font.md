## What is Xarab.shx Autocad Font?
 
Xarab.shx is a shape file that contains Arabic characters in a vector format. It was created by [CAD Studio](https://www.cadstudio.cz/en/download.asp), a company that provides software solutions for CAD and GIS. Xarab.shx is compatible with Autocad versions 2000 and higher, and it supports both left-to-right and right-to-left text directions.
 
Xarab.shx is not a true type font, which means that it does not have a fixed size or style. Instead, it is a collection of shapes that can be scaled and modified according to your preferences. You can change the color, width, height, rotation, and alignment of the characters using the standard Autocad commands.
 
## How to Install Xarab.shx Autocad Font?
 
To install Xarab.shx Autocad font, you need to download the shape file from [CAD Studio's website](https://www.cadstudio.cz/en/download.asp). The file name is xarab.zip, and it contains two files: xarab.shx and xarab.txt. The first one is the shape file, and the second one is a text file that explains how to use the font.
 
After downloading the zip file, you need to extract it to a folder on your computer. Then, you need to copy the xarab.shx file to the folder where your Autocad shape files are located. The default location is C:\Program Files\Autodesk\AutoCAD 20xx\Fonts, where xx is the version of your Autocad. If you have a different location, you can find it by typing (findfile "simplex.shx") in the Autocad command line.
 
Once you have copied the xarab.shx file to the Fonts folder, you need to restart Autocad for the changes to take effect. You can then use the Xarab.shx font in your drawings by typing STYLE in the command line and selecting XARAB from the list of available fonts.
 
## How to Use Xarab.shx Autocad Font?
 
To use Xarab.shx Autocad font, you need to type your text in Arabic using any text editor or online tool. Then, you need to copy and paste the text into Autocad using the MTEXT command. You can also use the DTEXT command if you want to enter one line of text at a time.
 
After pasting the text into Autocad, you need to select it and change its style to XARAB using the Properties panel or the STYLE command. You can then adjust the size, color, rotation, and alignment of the text using the standard Autocad commands.
 
If you want to edit the text later, you need to double-click on it and use the MTEXT editor or the DTEXT editor. You can also use the EXPLODE command to convert the text into individual shapes that can be modified separately.
